# Furniture-Company-System
A fully-rounded company system based on specific requests by an exporting company.
This system was programmed and designed solely by Patrick Nercessian.

*DISCLAIMER:* Because I was forced to remove all real client and factory information, the Distribution Log and possibly the Order Log do not work with this GitHub file. In reality, all features work correctly.

  Document Creation:
  
    Sales Contracts
